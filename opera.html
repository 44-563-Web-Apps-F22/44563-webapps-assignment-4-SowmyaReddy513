        <h5>Scene.—Palace Yard, Westminster.  Westminster Hall, L.  Clock
            tower up, R.C. Private Willis discovered on sentry, R. Moonlight.</h5>
        <p>When all night long a chap remains
            On sentry-go, to chase monotony
       He exercises of his brains,</p>
       <p>That is, assuming that he's got any.
        Though never nurtured in the lap
             Of luxury, yet I admonish you,</p>
             <p>I am an intellectual chap,
                And think of things that would astonish you.</p>
            <p>I often think it's comical—Fal, lal, la!
                How Nature always does contrive—Fal, lal, la!</p>
            <p>How Nature always does contrive—Fal, lal, la!
                That every boy and every gal
                     That's born into the world alive
                Is either a little Liberal
                     Or else a little Conservative!
                                    Fal, lal, la!</p>
            <p>When in that House M.P.'s divide,
                If they've a brain and cerebellum, too,
           They've got to leave that brain outside,
                And vote just as their leaders tell 'em to.</p>
            <p>But then the prospect of a lot
                Of dull M. P.'s in close proximity,
           All thinking for themselves, is what
                No man can face with equanimity.</p>
            <p>Then let's rejoice with loud Fal la—Fal lal la!
                That Nature always does contrive—Fal lal la!
                     That every boy and every gal
                          That's born into the world alive
                     Is either a little Liberal
                          Or else a little Conservative!
                                         Fal lal la!</p>
