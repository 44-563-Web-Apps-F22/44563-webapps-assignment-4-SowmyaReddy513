        <p class="song">When all night long a chap remains<br>
            On sentry-go, to chase monotony<br>
            He exercises of his brains,<br>
            That is, assuming that he's got any.<br>
            Though never nurtured in the lap<br>
            Of luxury, yet I admonish you,<br>
            I am an intellectual chap,<br>
            And think of things that would astonish you.<br>
            I often think it's comical—Fal, lal, la!<br>
            How Nature always does contrive—Fal, lal, la!<br>
            How Nature always does contrive—Fal, lal, la!<br>
            That every boy and every gal<br>
            That's born into the world alive<br>
            Is either a little Liberal<br>
            Or else a little Conservative!<br>
            Fal, lal, la!</p><br>
        <p class="song-2"> When in that House M.P.'s divide,<br>
            If they've a brain and cerebellum, too,<br>
            They've got to leave that brain outside,<br>
            And vote just as their leaders tell 'em to.<br>
            But then the prospect of a lot<br>
            Of dull M. P.'s in close proximity,<br>
            All thinking for themselves, is what<br>
            No man can face with equanimity.<br>
            Then let's rejoice with loud Fal la—Fal lal la!<br>
            That Nature always does contrive—Fal lal la!<br>
            That every boy and every gal<br>
            That's born into the world alive<br>
            Is either a little Liberal<br>
            Or else a little Conservative!<br>
            Fal lal la!</p>

        Annoyed! I should think so! Why, this
        ridiculous protege of yours is playing the deuce with everything!
        To-night is the second reading of his Bill to throw the Peerage
        open to Competitive Examination!

    <p class="speech">This comes of women interfering in politics. It
        so happens that if there is an institution in Great Britain which
        is not susceptible of any improvement at all, it is the House of
        Peers!</p>
